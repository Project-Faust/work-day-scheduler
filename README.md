# Work Day Scheduler

This project uses JavaScript in conjunction with HTML and CSS to create an interactive web application designed to deliver a simple yet effective tool for the user to store notes and create an hourly planner. Included functionalities are: using local broswer storage to allow created notes to remain if the page is closed and reopened at another time from the same browser and device; using the Day.js API to access the current local time in order to compare it to the corresponding hour block displayed on the web page and apply styling accordingly; using Day.js to access and display the current day of the week, date, and time in the header area of the web application; checking the time information provided by Day.js at regular intervals to ensure that the time and styling displayed on the page are up to date given the current hour.
